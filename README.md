## ✨ Features

- **AI Chat (mood-aware)**: Choose a mood and chat with an AI companion. The prompt is personalized using your assessment result.
- **Crisis keyword detection**: If a message indicates self-harm intent, the app shows a crisis message and tries to open the phone dialer (default: `999`).
- **Onboarding assessment**: A short questionnaire that assigns a narrative category + score.
- **Journaling**: Create, update, and delete journal entries stored in Firestore.
- **Community chat**: Simple global chat room backed by Firestore.
- **Progress screen**: A basic progress dashboard UI.
- **Memes feed**: A “need a laugh?” meme list section on the home screen.
- **Authentication**: Email/password auth via Firebase.
- **Cross-platform**: Runs on Android, iOS, and Web (with FlutterFire configuration).

## 🔧 Requirements

- **Flutter SDK**: compatible with Dart `^3.10.8` (see `pubspec.yaml`)
- **Dart**: `^3.10.8`
- **Android**: Android 5.0 (API 21) or higher
- **iOS**: iOS 11.0 or higher
- **Firebase Project**: Firebase project with Authentication + Firestore enabled

## 📦 Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai_health.git
cd ai_health
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Configure Firebase (FlutterFire)

Make sure you have the FlutterFire CLI installed, then run:

```bash
flutterfire configure
```

If you prefer platform-specific configuration:

```bash
flutterfire configure --platforms=android
flutterfire configure --platforms=ios
flutterfire configure --platforms=web
```

### 4. Enable Firebase services

In Firebase Console, enable:

- **Authentication**: Email/Password
- **Cloud Firestore**

For the AI chat:

- **Firebase AI (Gemini)**: enable Firebase AI / Gemini for your Firebase project (as required by the `firebase_ai` package).

### 5. Run the application

```bash
flutter run
```

## 🚀 Configuration

### Firebase setup

1. Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Enable:
   - Authentication (Email/Password)
   - Cloud Firestore
   - Firebase AI (Gemini)
3. Generate `lib/firebase_options.dart` using:

```bash
flutterfire configure
```

### Environment variables

The app uses Firebase configuration from `firebase_options.dart` (generated by FlutterFire). No additional environment variables are needed after Firebase configuration.

### Firestore data model (current)

The app currently uses these collections:

- `users/{uid}/journals/*`
- `users/{uid}/assessments/*`
- `rooms/global/messages/*`

## 💻 Usage

### Starting the app

1. Launch the app (splash screen)
2. Login / register
3. If you haven’t completed the initial assessment yet, you’ll be routed to the questions screen
4. Use the home screen to access:
   - Mood-based AI chat
   - Journal
   - Community chat
   - Progress
   - Settings

### Key workflows

#### Mood → AI Chat

```dart
// Tap a mood (Sad/Anxious/Angry/Tired) on Home
// You are taken to Chat and the assistant responds with a mood-aware opening message
```

#### Journaling

```dart
// Journal entries are stored under users/{uid}/journals
// Create/update/delete entries from the Journal screen
```

#### Community Chat

```dart
// Open Community from Home
// Messages are stored in Firestore under: rooms/global/messages
```

## 🔐 Safety notes (AI Chat)

- The AI assistant is configured with guardrails (no diagnosis, no medication advice, one gentle follow-up question).
- A basic crisis keyword check triggers a crisis message and attempts to open the dialer using `tel:999`.

If you want a different emergency number, update it in `lib/agent/ai_chat_service.dart`.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project uses **GetX** for routing and state management, with a simple separation of screens/controllers/models.

### Model layer

- Data models in `models/`

### View layer

- UI screens in `screens/`
- Reusable UI components in `widgets/`

### Controller layer

- Business logic and state in `controller/` (GetX controllers)

### Services

- Firebase integration (Auth, Firestore)
- AI integration via `firebase_ai` (Gemini)

## 📚 Technologies

### Core

- Flutter
- Dart

### State management / routing

- GetX (`get`)

### Backend

- Firebase Core
- Firebase Auth
- Cloud Firestore
- Firebase AI (`firebase_ai`)

### Utilities

- `url_launcher`
- `http`
- `cached_network_image`

## 📖 Getting started with development

### Building for production

#### Android

```bash
flutter build apk
# or
flutter build appbundle
```

#### iOS

```bash
flutter build ios
```

#### Web

```bash
flutter build web
```

### Running tests

```bash
flutter test
```

### Code analysis

```bash
flutter analyze
```

## 🆘 Support & Troubleshooting

### Firebase configuration error

```bash
flutterfire configure
```

### Dependency issues

```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

### Firestore permission errors

If you see permission errors, verify:

- Authentication is enabled and you are signed in
- Your Firestore security rules allow the authenticated user to read/write their own `users/{uid}` subcollections
